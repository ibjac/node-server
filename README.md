# Node-Server

A simple NodeJS web server to be used on your local Windows machine (though with some minor tweaks it should work for Mac). It is for development purposes only...not production ready. It uses the PHP-NODE package to run PHP and test php scripts in the browser.

[//]:# (## Code Example)
[//]:# (Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.)

[//]:# (## Motivation)
[//]:# (A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.)

## Installation

1. NodeJS for Windows: https://nodejs.org
2. PHP-NODE package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/php-node
3. PHP for Windows: http://windows.php.net/download/

[//]:# (## API Reference)
[//]:# (Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.)

## Test

Once all required installs are in place, you can start testing your php scripts.

1. Launch your command prompt
2. CD into your project's root folder
3. Start your node web server.

		$ node ..\node-server\server.js

4. Open browser to http://localhost:3000/yourpage.php and voila!
